I work non-stop with no breaks, skipping lunch, walking from meeting to meeting,etc. It just sucks and I don\\'t even feel this is not my final career path (working in manufacturing). My wife also makes 80K/yr \\n\\nFinancial Situation: My wife and I currently have a net worth of ~240K. This is split out ~100K cash and ~140K in investments (retirement). We have no debt, just expenses (~2000$/mo) on rent, food, etc. We have a upcoming wedding (20-30K) but expect a huge windfall from parents/relatives and cash gifts which would probably cancel out the wedding costs and have leftover cash \\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s holding me back: Of course if I switch careers I\\'ll start at entry level pay, so maybe 60K-65K?, also potentially losing my contribution to \"after-tax\" availability if I leave. Also medical,dental, etc. benefits and a 3000$ pension....\\n',\n",
