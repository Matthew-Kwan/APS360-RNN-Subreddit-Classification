2,2,"Background:
28 years old, I currently make 80K/year, drive 1.10 to 1.5 hrs (50 miles) one way each day. I wake up at 5 to 5:30 am and don't get home until 6 to 7 pm everyday. I work non-stop with no breaks, skipping lunch, walking from meeting to meeting,etc. It just sucks and I don't even feel this is not my final career path (working in manufacturing). My wife also makes 80K/yr 

Financial Situation: My wife and I currently have a net worth of ~240K. This is split out ~100K cash and ~140K in investments (retirement). We have no debt, just expenses (~2000$/mo) on rent, food, etc. We have a upcoming wedding (20-30K) but expect a huge windfall from parents/relatives and cash gifts which would probably cancel out the wedding costs and have leftover cash 


What's holding me back: Of course if I switch careers I'll start at entry level pay, so maybe 60K-65K?, also potentially losing my contribution to ""after-tax"" availability if I leave. Also medical,dental, etc. benefits and a 3000$ pension....

3,3,"At my company they offer 1/2 of what I put in up to me 10% and them 5%. It isn't specifically stated in the handbook but it was just known through word of mouth. I initially put in 10% through my first year just to get the match.


Recently I've been set on retiring earlier so I decided to up my contributions to 25%. The HR lady physically came up to me to make sure it wasn't a typo in my email. She even made me put in writing that I wanted to change my contribution from 10% to 25% and wanted to tell me that I would still only get 5% from the company. Apparently it is extremely uncommon if not unheard of for employees to put in over 10%.


I just checked my 401k transactions and saw that not only did I get my 25%, but the company matched 1/2 of that and contributed 12.5%.


Now, I had heard in the past that they will match 1/2 of what I put in up to $5,000 total. That makes me hesitant to say anything in case I'm grandfathered into the old plan. And I can't really believe the HR lady because she just repeats what she has heard through word of mouth. Nothing is in writing anywhere and I can't talk to anybody about it because nobody knows what is going on. Our plant is a remote location from a company in a foreign country.


What do I do?


Edit: Can they come calling for it at a later date? How do returns and losses affect that? If they give me $500 and try to take it away but the market tanks, do they still take $500 or a ""market adjusted"" $500?

However, I notice that each time they call, the amount due never changes - they don’t seem to be charging me interest. If I start making payments, will that start the clock on interest due? This will drive up the amount due quicker than my meager payments will pay it down.

So I had some medical bills go into collection, and was now in a position to do something about it. After numerous times calling, I got ahold of the law office who is trying to service the debt. We decided to start a $100 payment per month to get the ball rolling.

Fast forward to a few days after my first withdrawal, I get a new call from a law office stating they are now collecting for the Hospital, and they show no record of payment. Wait. A few weeks hoping the records would update, and nope, never did.

I’m moving my Roth IRA investments out of a target date fund and into other index funds (mostly to reduce the expense ratio), but I’m discovering that a few of the funds that I was interested in (e.g. VBMFX and VTSMX) are “closed” and thus I cannot purchase shares. 

I want to put my money into a total US stock market fund and a total US bond market fund (among others), and Vanguard does allow me to invest in their total bond market index fund admiral shares (VBTLX) their total stock market index fund admiral shares (VTSAX). Is there any downside to investing in admiral shares? From what I can gather via some initial [research](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102715/what-are-vanguards-admiral-shares.asp), admiral funds often have lower expense ratios. Now that Vanguard has lowered the initial investment to $3k instead of $10k, there doesn’t seem to be any downside. However, maybe some folks here know more.

8,8,"My fiance and I are closing on our first house later this week, which made last week's news about the ""biggest rate drop in a decade"" very exciting (http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/). I was hoping it was something we could take advantage of at the 11th hour. 

However, my mortgage broker quickly squashed that. In her reply when I reached out to her last week with that Freddie Mac article, she said that recent drop had already been factored in when we were locked at **4.5%**. She said these reported rates are deceptive and skewed by loans with large numbers of discount points, and implied it was really too late to do anything at this point anyway.

The comment about discount points seems off, because it looks like the Freddie Mac averages account for discount points (0.5 for the 30 yr fixed). Rule of thumb I have heard is a single point translates to about a 1/4 of a %, so that math doesn't seem right. I'm honestly not sure about whether its too late to do make a change; we've definitely had to send a lot of paperwork over so i could see how that would be a lot to rework through in a couple of days. Not sure if this is also impacted by the fact that she would have to go back to the bank and secure the new rate, which she has mentioned costs her $ (might not be something she wants to do again).

I'd greatly appreciate anyone's feedback on our situation and what options we might still have. Even if the consensus is our broker is spot on, that would provide some piece of mind. Thanks in advance.

Other mortgage details in case they matter:

* Loan type: conventional, 30 yr fixed

* No points

* 20% down

* Credit scores: fiance and I are both 780+

* Location: Texas

9,9,"I put in my two weeks notice at a small business I've been working for for the past 6 months. I got a job offer at a bigger company with great benefits, mainly: 20+ days PTO a year that can roll over up to a cap and the company pays a large chunk for health benefits so employees pay very little. The pay is more than what I'm currently making and it's closer to my home. 

Shortly after I put my notice in, I get a call from the owner of the company I currently work for. He offered me a $4 raise plus a sliding wage depending on how well the company does, 10 days PTO (company only offers 5), and $250 in cash once a month. I was really surprised they would offer that to me considering I'm only an office assistant and it sounds very tempting. He said this was only between me and him and no one else would know. It seemed a little weird that he would offer that to a basic office assistant. I'm not sure what to do...

11,11,"I've made a throw-away / anon account because, while I am happy to discuss certain details - I am *ashamed* of my past decisions.  Please don't judge me.  

I'm 39 years old.  I make 89k/year and I bring home 5500 a month after taxes.  My wife makes 0 - and is an alcoholic.  She and I are both doing our own separate therapy sessions.  For obvious reasons.  I am deeply depressed, feel like my life as a man is to spend my time and energy earning money so that others can spend it.  

She's drinking about 12 bucks a day in vodka/wine and spending about 300 a month on pot.  I don't smoke.  I can't. 

It's just the two of us.

We have, what I think, is a pretty trimmed down budget.  The reason we have two car payments is because of when her prior car died - I picked the new one up for her and I told myself then it would be safer should I run into issues. (My commute was VERY long at the time.  Now it's only about 30 mins tops each way.)

* Our car payments total about 1100 a month.  
* Our utils and rent is 2000 (including electric, water/sewer, internet, and cell phones).
* Our grocery bill (which transfers to its own card) is 700 a month
* I spend about 30 a week on fuel and lunches at work.  Maybe a little less.  I honestly *love* bringing in my own lunch - I can be creative and feel like I'm doing my part.  Plus there's too much salt in the fast food places.  
* We have Netflix/Hulu/Spotify at about 40 a month total. 
* Life insurance is about 50 a month
* Car insurance is about 120 a month
* Work has a retirement plan (it's actually a 403, I think) and I put in the same amount they'll match.  

Now for the shit I'm ashamed of.

I have a credit card @18% that has a balance of 24k on it.  The min payment is about 500 a month.  I can make that.   I have a home equity loan (40k) on a house back in New England that's paid off that I collect rent on - I don't count that rent into my income; it stays to provide taxes/upgrades/repair to the house.  But I pay the 250 a month min payment (interest only) on the equity out of my work paycheck.  

So all in all - I bring in about 5500 a month, I budget out about 5k and I have ""left over"" about 500.  That gets spent on bullshit like pot that my stupid beta blue-pilled self thinks will make my wife be kind to me.  All in all, if I were to sell everything, including the house, pay off loans, and sit back and look, I'd have about 30k positive to put into a small pile in the bed and roll around on top of.

My plan is:

Cut back.  I've removed extra services on the streaming sites - like hbo and filmon.tv; I've stopped my digital ocean droplet (I write software) saving me about 5 bucks a month.  I'm not carrying around my credit cards anymore.  I'm taking the credit card away from my wife.  She can use the grocery card - and when it's done it's done.  If she wants extra shit - I can say no.  She can complain and treat me like shit. She can be a drunk with grocery card money.  

At the end of the month, before the next paycheck, anything I have leftover  I am going to put onto that credit card.  I'm also going to keep renting that house out - I have about 4k in the bank for that house's account - I am going to start paying some of that equity loan down.  

I will also have the option to work remote, I believe, come the autumn.  My tenants will be on a month-to-month lease by then, and I can ask them to move out, move back to CT, and ""save"" 1300 a month in what I'd pay for rent.  Though that'll only net me about 800 a month savings, because of taxes, etc.  

I know I'm a pushover.  I know I am stupid for letting my wife spend up so much on our card thinking ""happy wife she'll be sober and I'll be happy.""  I'm terribly depressed about all of this, think about it 24/7 and frankly feel like I'd be ""richer"" if I was dead.

12,12,"My wife and I are moving from one part of Minneapolis to another. We're buying a new house, then selling our current house after we've moved. That way we can avoid doing a contingent sale and having a more hectic moving experience.

We expect our current house to sell for $100. (I'm using fake amounts here, obviously. For $100, imagine our house is a very nice tent.) The balance of our mortgage is $50.

The new house is $80. We plan to put all the proceeds from the sale of our current house into the new house. But since we're buying the new house before selling our current house, we need another source for the down-payment.

Here are the two options we're considering:

1. We have $8 in stocks (not tied up in retirement). We cash that out to make a 10% down-payment on the new house, and start a mortgage with PMI. When our current house sells, we put the $30 in proceeds into the new house and refinance the mortgage to get rid of PMI.

2. We take out a ""bridge loan"" to make a $16/20% down-payment on the new house, which lets us avoid PMI. When our current house sells, we use the $30 in proceeds to pay off the bridge loan and put the rest toward the balance of the mortgage.

I think option #2 is better because the amount we would pay in interest on the bridge loan is probably a lot less than (a) what we would lose by no longer having those stocks appreciating, combined with (b) the capital gains tax we'd need to pay for cashing them out.

I'm questioning everything right now. All my choices. All my plans. Everything.

My husband and I live a comfortable life. We aren't rich, but we aren't destitute either. He's our sole earner, and so, when our son goes to school, our plan was that I would return to work.

I'm so close to finishing my degree, and becoming a teacher. It isn't necessarily my dream job, but I believe I would genuinely like it. I've always enjoyed working with people. In fact, the only jobs I've ever had  were caregiving (adults with physical and mental disabilities), and daycare teaching. 

I genuinely loved them both, and considered going back to being a caregiver, but we thought teaching made the most sense. I would get to work with kids (something I love), and I would have off all of my son's school holidays as well. It seemed like the most perfect setup possible.

Now I wonder if I should get into something I don't necessarily like, but will make far more money. It would mean giving up school holidays with my son, and moving into a career path that I would probably hate, but maybe it would be worth it? Just for the added security?

All this wouldn't have even entered my mind, except I've spent the last four years watching just how bad life can fuck you over, even if you do everything right.

Four years ago, my best friend was in a similar position as we are now. Her husband, like my husband, was the breadwinner. She had a job and made good money for our area. (Midwest, low income area.)

Their lives were on track, and they were doing wonderfully...until he got sick. The doctors gave him 6 months to live. He made it 71 days.

71 days.

That's all it took for their lives to go from perfect, to complete ruin. Prior to the diagnosis they didn't even know anything was wrong. They had no time to prepare. My best friend lost the love of her life, and her poor sons lost their father.

The financial turmoil began slowly, but in the end, she lost everything. Her $15/hr wasn't enough to keep them afloat. They had filed bankruptcy already due to another medical disaster just 3 years prior, so that wasn't an option. His insurance denied payment on most of the medical bills, and suddenly she found herself so far in debt she couldn't keep her head above water.

She lost her house.

She couldn't find a place that would rent to her.

Her wages were being garnished.

She was homeless, with two children below the age ten.

We took them in until they could gain their footing again. 

Now that her disaster has entered the healing stages, and she doesn't need my support as much, I have found myself consumed with the 'what if' worries.

How can I justify taking a job as a teacher, making *maybe* 35k a year, when I **saw** what that sort of planning can do to a family. How can anyone possibly plan for this sort of disaster? I saw what those medical bills were like. I held her as she sobbed, telling me how she would never be able to pull herself out of this hole. Those numbers were well beyond what I could ever expect to put in a savings or emergency fund. Hell, they were more than what most of the houses in our area are worth. So an emergency fund isn't the answer.

I can't get this all out of my head. I can't stop thinking about whether or not I'm making the wrong decision for my son. 

I watched her sons deteriorate because when their father died, all their stability went with him. The home they'd grown up in belonged to strangers. They had to share a weird guest bedroom, and live with other people while still trying to grieve.

I won't let that happen to my son. I won't let everything we worked for be ripped away from him because one of his parents may one day have the audacity to die.

How can I make sure that if the worst happens, he is still taken care of? How can I make sure that the remaining parent doesn't have to face their spouse's death with the added stress of losing everything? How do you plan for bills of that magnitude?

I wanted to run my current budget by everyone as my household needs a new car and wanted to consider options accordingly. I'm mostly looking for a guideline on payment amounts and if I'm being absurd or not. I am almost 24 and I live in a major metropolitan area (east coast) for context. We live together and have the same rent and monthly dining expenses.

&#x200B;

I take home \~ 4800 a month after taxes and a 6% 401K contribution (fully matched by company up to 6%). All healthcare costs are covered by my employer, and I have a HSA with a few thousand in it. I have 11K in an emergency fund and over 20k in my primary checking due to recent bonuses. I currently own one car which is fully paid off (2010 Nissan Altima). I pay 1400 a month for rent and all associated utilities (internet, elec, gas, etc.), \~ 65 a month in gas, \~250-300 a month in groceries, car insurance for this car is 70 a month, and parking is $250 a month. I usually will spend around $250 a month for dining out, either lunch during the day or with the gf on weekends. Generally each months surplus goes directly towards an investment account, that is going to work towards a downpayment on a house within 3-5 years. Her new job requires a car but she doesn't have one. Her income is not completely consistent but its safe to assume she will make similar to what I do. We are planning on getting married within a few years and our current down payment investment accounts (we keep them separate) have a combined 60k in it.

I want to get a new car and have her use the old one for the time being rather than go out and buy herself a new one, as we have saved a lot of money for a down payment and I don't want to dip into that to buy a new car in cash. I like the idea of treating myself, as I've landed a great career and have no debt and a significant amount of wiggle room. Is a 0 money down lease of around $500-600 a month inappropriate? My credit is close to 800 and I can get rates just under 3%. I wanted to lease rather than buy as cars are my primary indulgence, but I have never been able to pull the trigger. Alternatively, buying a used car around 30K is a possibility.

We will be speaking with a financial planner/adviser but I am trying to project out our net worth and investments and wanted to run my assumptions past some people to vet them. How do the following assumptions look?

**Split net income 50/50 between cash and investments** (I'd like more towards investments but my wife is risk-averse and so this may be a compromise. Should this percentage move more towards cash as we get older to mitigate risk levels?)

**Annual Salary Raise: 3%** (based on our historical averages, which are typically higher but I'm being conservative)

**Effective Tax Rate: 30%** (I know this is high, even with how much we earn, but figured it's better to be conservative)

**Spending Increase, Annual: 8%** (I found this number online, but it seems high, and it makes our net liquid assets go negative after 12 years)

**Cost-of-Living and Inflation: 3%**

**Savings Account Interest: 2.25%** (current rate, I will adjust as it changes)

**Investment Growth: 7% annual** (again, I've seen this assumption online, but as it is lower than the spending increase, it seems low).

**Mortgage Interest Rate: 5%** (assume purchase in 2022, being conservative with the rate given our credit rating and the pre-approval we got a few years when we looked for a bit)

**Child Expenses: 20K/year per child** (assume one child in 2020, another in 2022, with costs increasing annually per the inflation number, above

During residency the salary is a fraction of a fully licensed physician. At this point, would banks allow me to refinance these loans to a lower interest rate?

Apologies in advance if this is a silly question. I have a full time job but have started to sell a few small things online this month.

Can it be self-employment if I'd end up making so little a week, barely enough to cover any NI contributions (I understand these are about £3/week if you're self employed?) as well as the percentage of tax?

59,59,"Hello all, first post to /r/personalfinance.
  
A [Black Swan Event] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) is an occurrence which has vast effects on the fabric of whatever context it exists in, which generally seems inevitable and obvious in hindsight but was actually very hard to predict before it occurred. Examples of this include the development and spread of nuclear weapons, the popularization of roadside amenities such as motels and drive-thrus at the hand of mass adoption of cars and roadways in the 20th century, the creation of a profitable market for refrigeration from the creation of a nationwide railway system in the 19th century, etc.
  
Ignoring events such as epidemics and natural disasters, it can be observed that many of these events are a result of advancing technology. It can also be noted that the unpredictability of such a technology-driven event lies in the creation of several new markets at the rise of each world-changing invention, as well as the death of several old. Total world ownership of horses peaked in 1910. A blacksmith who's been in the family business that has existed for 300 years soon found himself out of business just a few years beyond that point. Meanwhile, those in the oil exploitation business became the richest people to ever exist. 
  
There are billionaires now in their 20's who simply capitalized on the network-attached supercomputers already in everyone's pocket by writing online social media applications for them. The billionaires who preceded *them* put those computers there by building an empire which made the hardware necessary to increase communication and trade speeds a thousandfold at the turn of the 21^st century. No one in 1979 checking out a Commodore PET could have predicted that in less than 40 years they would only ever drive to brick-and-mortar stores to buy groceries any more because of that chunky thing on the table.
  
What I want to generally ask about, as well as provoke discussion on, is this: What is the next ""killer app"", and what are some likely to occur yet non-intuitive side effects of these developments? We can already see that there are going to shortly be large advances in things like self-driving cars, vastly cheaper access to space, improving virtual reality, brain-machine interfaces, solar energy, labor reducing general robotics, and other developing technologies. My question is, what are the less thought-of impacts of these likely developments (and how can they be invested in?)

I will be providing screenshots of my budget so you can see a clear picture. I also am trying to [incorporate the flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) found in the wiki. It feels weird showing strangers my $$$. Like I am naked.

-----------------------------------

TL;DR - New job = More Money = more problems? Here are some of the questions I have: 

1. When is a financial planner worth talking to and how do I find a good one.
2. Debts - student loans: How should I tackle my loans as well as the wife's loans. 
3. retirement how does one do that.
4. 

**In depth below!** 

------------------------------------------

**Background** 

* Married (M = Jay [31yo, credit score: 812], F= Kay [31yo, credit score: 799 ])
* Occupation: Registered Nurse  (both of us)
* Location: **California** (in a very expensive city)
* Salary: **Jay = $41.50** @ 40hrs a week, **Kay = $38.07** @ 36 hours a week
* No kids 
* No credit card debt 

We put each other through nursing school these last 5 years. So we have been a single income family. This also meant we could not tackle student loans which resulted in them getting much bigger. Once the wife got her nursing job we have been living on her income pretty comfortably using YNAB to budget. 


---------------------------------------
**DEBTS**

*We have three debts that need to worked on*. 

1. Car loan as it stands today. 

> * balance: $9154.61 
* Monthly payment: $358.07 
* interest: @ 1.49% (thanks credit union) 

2. Kay fasfa Student loan 

> * Balance: $37,673.59
* Monthly Minimum payment: $188.37
* interest: unsub = [@6.5 \(5.16\), sub = 3.150, 5.750, 3.980](https://imgur.com/lm75TNk) 

3. Jay fasfa student loan 

> * Balance: $66,839.45
* Monthly payment: $ ???
* interest: [@ ????](https://imgur.com/ZT9ye4u)

According to my calculations. It would be best to make minimum payment to the $70k loan and $30K loan and use the snowball/avalanche method to pay these debts off starting with the car loan. I have never talked to my loan officer and have no clue if there are resources out there to help get out of this student loan debt. 

-------------------------------------------------
**Plans** 

I want our **quality of life to improve** from where its at currently but at the same time I want to pay off debts faster. There needs to be a balance. Wife wants to travel the world and I want to spend more money on my PC and hobbies. 

- New home: We currently live in a studio loft apartment meant for a bachelor lifestyle. We are cramped to put it mildly.  Adding 300$-700$ to the rent budget can get us into a decent 1BDRM apartment. Wife is ok as is and would rather use that money towards debts.

Feels like a wall of text. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",1,0,Years ago this subreddit helped me get out of credit card debt. Thank you! I now come back seeking help. I just got hired and am going to be making more money that I have ever made in my life.

66,66,"So I’m in my mid twenties and looking to trade in the car I’ve had since high school for something more practical for my life now. My current car is worth about $4,000 according to KBB and I want to trade that in or sell it myself. I have about $16,000 total in savings to my name to put a portion of towards the new car. 


I currently have no credit whatsoever. I’ve used a debit card since I started working around age 15 and just never really understand the importance of building/having credit until now. (I’ve started following this sub to try to catch up on my financial knowledge) My parents however have excellent credit and would be willing to co-sign on a loan with me, 


My question is- what’s the best place to get a loan, how long of a loan, how much of my savings should I use for a down payment, and what’s the total cost I can afford for a new car. 


I make about $40,000 a year and could afford a monthly payment of up to about $400 comfortably while still being able to save money at the same time each month. 


The used car I would like to get, if I can afford it without breaking my bank, costs about $25,000 . I honestly have no idea if this is realistic for me or not. If it makes more sense for my life long term I’m open to getting an older car with more miles for less money total. 


I honestly am kind of embarrassed that at my age I have so little knowledge on how any of this works. Any advice or guidance is appreciated! 


Edit- 


I forgot to mention, the idea of getting the car loan would be to build my currently nonexistent credit score. 


Also my current car isn’t in great shape and isn’t big enough for my current needs. I have a very large dog and plan on getting another large dog within the next five years. I also do a lot of camping and want something better suited for that and moving kayaks/bikes around along with pets. 


The car I’m looking at is a Toyota 4Runner, and what drew me to that was the size, off-road capability, and covered cargo space.  This is a car me and my husband would both plan to use for the next 5-10 years. 


If it makes more sense to use the full $16,000 to just buy an older model or a cheaper car I’m open to that. 


Also I should note that $16,000 isn’t the total of my savings, it’s just the fraction of my savings I would feel comfortable using for this. 


Another Edit- 


My husband makes more than I do and has his own separate savings. He has a new (also somewhat small) car that’s already paid off. We rent currently as we don’t plan on staying in the area we currently work in for more than the next five years or so.

69,69,"Hi PF! I have recently become eligible to start investing in my new employers 401K plan. The problem is that upon looking into it I am not exactly thrilled with any of the plan options (High Fees and expense ratios with mediocre performance) and It should be noted that my employer is NOT matching any contributions at all.

So my question is should I bother or are there alternatives that I am not seeing? And If i do contribute should it be to Roth 401K, traditional 401K, or both?

possible pertinent details:

* My yearly pre-tax income is in the 70K-100K range (It varies based on hours worked, So far this year i am on target to reach 75K, but that could easily change in the 3rd or 4th quarter this year)
* I already max out Roth IRA contributions each year, and have already maxed out this years contribution.
* I have a substantial savings (I don't have a lot of job security so I like to have a sizable emergency fund) Which means I can afford to contribute more than the yearly max IRA contributions and would like to put more money into tax advantaged retirement savings than I currently am.
* I do not have any debt and I own my car outright. My only recurring expenses are rent, utilities, and lifestyle expenses.
* I am in my mid 20's
* I am a W-2 employee, which as i have come to understand, means I can't open my own 401K at a brokerage i prefer (such as vanguard)
* I have never had a 401K. my previous employer did not offer one. My only ""retirement"" savings are ~6 years worth of Roth IRA contributions.

TLDR - Not thrilled with new 401K plan. should I still use it or just take that money and invest it elsewhere? If I do use the 401K plan - Roth or traditional?

As the title suggests, I’m currently a college student. I recently started working part time, along side class and will be continuing the same job in the summer full time.
For this reason I came across 401k’s and I got a little confused. Since I am part-time I have no available matching. 
Right now I earn very little, so I think my best bet is to choose Roth 401k over regular. Question 1) Since I earn under 12000 a year, will any tax I pay on this be refunded when I file taxes

In the future, however, I will more than likely earn more (if all goes well) and will probably have incentive to switch to regular 401k. Question 2 and 3) Is it a bad idea to use Roth right now and Regular in the future, effectively splitting my earnings? If so, should I move all my money once I start using a regular 401k, or should I just use a regular 401k from the beginning?

Question 4) Is there a goal amount I should look to save for retirement? The calculator I tried to use, used my current earnings to calculate my cost of living and spending habits which is a huge underestimation of what it actually is

Question 5) Is it worth to just save as much money as I can into my 401k (approx 75% of my earnings)? I don’t use most of it, so it kind of sits in my checking account.

&#x200B;

1. Can we move the investment amount directly from the EJ investment account to our Savings account we already have? Is this possible? And then pull half of the amount to pay debts first, and then open an Investment/Brokerage Account and move the rest to a new Invest/Brokerage account that we open? (I'm not sure which investment firm yet, but looking at Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Ally Invest)
2. Move the entire investment amount to a new investment account that we open and then pull money directly from our new investment account to pay off debts? Would this be easy or is it more complicated to pull money from here?

&#x200B;

Also, it looks like there's a 95 transfer out/closing account fee at Edward Jones. If we transfer to another account, would the new firm be able to reimburse this fee?

My question is who should I look at as a provider for this plan? Would Fidelity or Schwab or Merril Lynch be able to open a plan for me for the minimum? Do they service all different states unlike VG?

Also I know my in laws would prefer to put money in a NJ plan.  The expense ratios for NJ range from 9-91 basis points.  If they’re not getting the state tax benefit anyway, would I be doing them any harm by setting one up with NJ? Lastly who the heck do I call to set up a NJ plan?

Well because i was stupid and didn't test drive it in silence and jumped in paired my phone and jammed out I never heard the noises that the rack and pinion were making ($1800 part) well I'm now super upside down in it and am thinking of saving up 5k for a new car to get within the year. My question is should I put as much money towards the loan or, should I pay as much as I can to try to get some equity in the car. Or should I just save up money in cash go trade it in and roll the  negative equity into the new loan. I have had the car since October 22nd and honestly probably wont have the 5K until around October so that would give me a year of payments and owning the car.",0,0,Got screwed on a car need advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b81xb2/got_screwed_on_a_car_need_advice/

91,91,"So, I've posted this to the Lenovo forums and will follow up with them by phone on Monday, but thought I'd ask folks here for advice on how to pursue this. I have worked for years to build by credit rating back up, and am terrified of anything that could ill-affect it now. Here's the story:

&#x200B;

On February 5th I ordered a bluetooth keyboard from Lenovo. Immediately after ordering I realized I could have purchased on Amazon for a few bucks more but had it delivered in two days instead of 2-3 weeks from Lenovo (their slow shipping is a separate story...). I called Lenovo customer support within minutes and they told me the order would be cancelled. I didn't expect a refund immediately, but assumed the issue was resolved and went ahead and order a keyboard from Amazon.

Fast forward two weeks and I get an email saying the Lenovo order has shipped. I contact them via Twitter DM and they acknowledge their mistake. They tell me to refuse shipment when it arrives so it can be returned. I live in an apartment building where packages are placed in a central location, and in any case, packages arrive while I'm at work. Refusal is impossible, and I tell them this. I ask what to do --- no response. I tell them I'm going to be disputing the charge with Amex if I don't hear back.

&#x200B;

I hear nothing so I dispute the charge.

&#x200B;

A month later I get an email from accounts payable at Lenovo asking why I hadn't paid for this item (clearly they don't communicate with customer support). I explain why in an email. They don't reply.

This Friday I get a letter from a DEBT COLLECTION agency telling me I have 30 days to reply over this ""debt."" (Of course, it arrives Friday, is dated 7 days earlier... anything these firms can do to make it harder for you to meet the requirements).

&#x200B;

I've read up and know there are ways to dispute debts like this in writing, hopefully preventing them from ending up in your credit report. But I can't believe I'm even at this point, over a $75 charge no less.

&#x200B;

Sadly, I am willing to just pay the firm to make this go away (though I know even if I do that sometimes the problems don't go away). I CANNOT have a nick on my credit report. If this was just Lenovo bugging me I could continue trying to return the keyboard. But now that it's in the hands of a debt collection firm (I'm not sure if they are simply collecting for them or have bought the debt? That might be relevant here), it's a whole new ball game. Keep in mind this all happened in less than 2 months. I suppose let this also be a warning if you plan to deal with Lenovo for anything. I'm a longtime Thinkpad buyer but never again.

&#x200B;

What do folks think is the best course of action here?

EDIT:

Several people have pointed out I should have taken more initiative to return the item. I am willing to concede that. I felt that Lenovo was screwing up so it was on them to offer me a way to return. Whether that was right is debatable. In any case I obviously would have pursued that much quicker if I had any idea this would result. I may have been naive. BUT, at this point my ONLY CONCERN is avoiding this affecting my credit rating. I have spent years getting it back up and can't fathom it going down 100 points again. My problem is that I don't trust Lenovo to resolve this ONCE a debt collection firm is involved. And if I just pay the firm (which I am more than happy to do) that would apparently actually ensure it DOES end up on my credit report? I could dispute the debt, but honestly I would prefer to just pay it -- but according to several posters here once a DC firm is involving disputing is my best bet? I do not want to have to take this up with each rating agency. This seems so easily solved since I'm willing to pay whomever, but that doesn't appear to be the case...  


EDIT #2: Here is the actual way the debt collection letter begins. Some here have suggested it might not mean the debt has been sold:  


 

""Creditor: Lenovo Claim #: xxxx Account #: yyyy Amount Due: $74.02

But the problem is, Alliant Credit Union has two factor authentication and many users have said you can't possibly connect mint or other planning programs to it in order to track your finances so basically, Alliant is extremely hard to track finances.

I feel as if having my money in one of these accounts would discourage me from using it, but give me enough freedom to access it if needed.

At personalfinancecanada we have long struggled with providing high quality advice. Everywhere on the internet you see the meme of ""Would someone on the internet really lie?"" or jokes about trusting someone from the internet. This subreddit is no exception. Every single day the mods are forced to remove low effort, low quality advice.

At this point, it's become too frustrating. We cannot continue to remove every post advising people to use free (for a reason) tax software, discount screw-it-up-yourself brokerages, advice on how to buy a shitty car, or every wise crack about how an insurance CORPORATION can protect your family. If we removed everything there would be no subreddit, so we're forced to pivot^table . 

For that reason the mods have started an initiative to clean up this cesspool. 

**We have started by partnering with a number of low cost tax preparors. At this time all tax advice topics will be simply met with a series of bids.** Bids start at $50. Each bid will come from an approved tax preparor who is EFILE certified, and therefore an expert. The bid will include a little schmoozing to get you comfortable with their expertise and then you can select your favourite tax preparer (preparor? Which one has the fiduciary duty again?) 

Anyone offering tax advice will be banned in these topics. No, I don't care about how OP just needs to ""file their T4 it's easy, use Simpletax"". It's called a T1, you dummy.

Not providing an update would be a disservice to all of you fine people in this subreddit. So, on to the details!

The person that was in the MLM company turned out to be my friend's sister in law. Besides them it was 3 other friends (including me) that were present. 

She pretty much just ran with a low grade PowerPoint presentation along with a speech to emphasize the ""data"" she was showing us. I say data VERY loosely. 

As she went through the presentation I periodically asked questions that you all had suggested. It was to great effect. Firstly, it showed me that she DIDN'T really have the charlatan silky sales pitch skills some of you told me I'd face. Secondly, she quickly became more and more nervous as I prodded for further details. 

The very first few slides were depicting the state of Canadians and their lack of financial security. I asked at this point where the data was sourced from. She advised me it was from Statistics Canada. Looking at the bottom of the slides, I saw the actual source: **Sourced from: 10 things Stats Canada doesn't want you to know!**

Okay, so that's BS. 

She then began setting up exactly what I expected, the IRP pitch. She compared it against investing into RRSP's, TFSA's. She only highlighted the magic of the product and how it would outperform either option. Clearly, everyone should be doing it! The calculations used to show how the IRP outperforms everything else were so poor that I was having a hard time keeping my facial expressions neutral. 

At this point I asked for the MER cost of the IRP. She said that it averaged from 3-5% annually. I asked what types of funds they invested in. She ""didn't"" have that information with her. We kept rolling through the slides tailored to draw on a person's emotions of earning so much more money!!!!

I pointed out that her calculations were incredibly inflated, didn't show any costs nor accurately portrayed the life cycle of the IRP, nor any of the risks that came with it. She had no immediate defense to that beyond: ""Well, this is just to show the general picture.""

When she finished, I asked what the company's revenue structure is like. I pointed to my friend and said, ""how much does he make from signing people on to a IRP, and how much does he get for getting people to join up with the Greatway MLM"". 

At this point my friend was a bit defensive. He quickly said to me: ""Dude, I told you, this isn't an MLM!"" Her reply was golden: ""No, it is an MLM actually."" 

She also couldn't provide me with much detail on the revenue breakdown. What she did say was:

- My friend would get all of the profit from selling IRP's. 
- She did admit she gets a percentage of his signing on bonuses but claimed that reduces overtime. 

As the night wrapped up I spoke to my friend frankly and said that given his excitement about this, and lack of knowledge on the subject matter and details concerned me. It showed me he has been thinking about this emotionally and not looking at the big picture critically. He admitted as much but still wanted to see this through. 

So while I'm not sure how much good my being there did, at the very least I'm hoping it triggers some thought if and when he realizes he's not earning what he expected. 

Thanks again to everyone that chimed in last time. It was extremely helpful!

I kind of gave up on film and went to college for nursing. Once I was in school I accepted a part time marketing job from the college itself for making content for their social channels. While in college I met some friends. Eventually, we started a company that got some big clients (WestJet, ScotiaBank)- I never made a cent the main asset because I was giving up my offered pay so it would go back into the company (other co-founders and myself didn’t sign any contracts for equity-my fault). Then, our main social media page with 700k followed was sold off to Narcity. 

Now I’ve just been layed off from a supply chain marketing company with Stihl and Mercedes Benz corporate as their clients. I’ve worked for them for exactly one year but it’s kind of clear to me that they want me gone (I made too many waves for a family run business I guess). I also completely undersold myself to them in the beginning by saying I’d work for free to get experience (this was when my company was becoming more and more “sold out”). I worked for free for 2-3 months and then got to manage their Shopify warehouse for Stihl (we sold to all Stihl dealerships across Canada) as well as go to trade shows, do product photography etc.

121,121,"My SO's parents have a vacant lot adjacent to their house that they are willing to sell to us and help us develop on. There seems to be a few different options available to tackle this, and I'm concerned about my lack of understanding on legal/tax implications of the different routes we could take. Any advice is appreciated!

The land was purchased as a single lot years ago with SO's parent's primary residence on it. A few years back, they subdivided the lot, and are now willing to sell us the vacant portion of the lot and help us put a modest home on it. I'm not sure how we should best go about developing this, as SO and I are first time home-buyers, and want to take advantage of those benefits. We also will have around 10% down for the final cost of the house/lot. 

The way I see it, we have two options:

1. SO's parents build the house on their line of credit, sell us the house and land for the appraised cost of land + actual cost to build. 

* We would be able to get a traditional mortgage this way
* This is current method proposed by parents
* Will this cause capital gains tax for SO's parents? 
* Sale price will likely end up $100,000 or more less than market price due to heated real estate market where we live. If the sale price is 480k, but the bank appraises the house at 550k, do we lost out on first time home buyers? Will there be any sort of gift tax if the sale price is below market price?

2. SO's parents sell us the lot, lend us cash to cover the increased down payment requirements to buy land and build. 
* Seems more complicated, longer period of time that we would owe money to parents
* Home buyers exemption clearly states that in this case, we can have up to 525k fair market cost of land + build costs, so it seems less likely we would lose the exemption

Hopefully this made a bit of sense. Any help appreciated!

That said, I have been a long time reader of PFC in particular, and I scanned the search before posting this... No genders/names to keep it neutral. EDIT: I apologize for the formatting - I'm trying to figure it out!


I'm based in Alberta. A couple weeks ago I met someone as I was going through my day. As we got to talking they told me they were in the process of transitioning out of their full time job and into retirement. As this person was in their mid to late 20s I was mega curious, as I've been in the pursuit of FI with the hope to retire in the next 10/15 years. We ended up agreeing to meet at a later date to talk and at this point they had alluded to ""connections to help build and manage assets.""


Because it was a fairly short interaction I didn't think too much of the vague comment and figured I'd find out more once we met up again.


Fast forward a week or so and we've met up. At this point, they are talking to me about trust being the backbone of relationships, and that what they're offering is more of a mentorship that may transition into me being introduced to their connections at some distant point in time. Through this whole thing they were super nice to me, very complimentary which always raises a red flag for me as I'm rather suspicious by nature. They even brought up how there's an abundance of resources and how suspicious and skeptical people are of people offering assistance and connections to succeed. The key idea emphasized in this meeting was that they wanted to make sure that I was a good fit with them and that I have the potential and mindset. Trust was also emphasized. I asked questions about what the assets building/management was and I was told that it involved online platforms but not a lot of other information.


An outline of how this mentorship proceeds was provided - a couple meet and greets, about 2-3 ""board panels"" and a follow up with the mentor after each one. After the final followup the option to meet the mentors contacts may be offered in the form of a partnership IF it still seems like a good fit. I specifically asked about financial commitment and they told me there is nothing required through the first part. No details were offered on financial commitments after the so-called partnership.


They did give me a book to read after the first meet and greet, which I'm to read and return at the second meet and greet. It's a book that's not affiliated with anything - the ""Don't Eat Your Marshmallows... Yet"" book.


Has anyone encountered this previously, if so, what IS this. I haven't been able to determine specifically if it is a scam yet because I don't have enough details - but that's precisely why I feel like it is.



**TLDR:**    
1. met a person who was FIRE.    
2. they met up with me for coffee and started telling me about this mentorship and assist building/management ""opportunity"" but have been SUPER vague.

149,149,"Ok! So, we've put a conditional offer on a house that has been accepted. Yay! I'm trying to figure out what our best option is for the allocation of funds.

Our new mortgage (mortgage B) will be more than our current one (mortgage A). We have some cash for the downpayment, and we'll use our HELOC for the rest. We also will want to do some renos before we move into the new home (in the realm of $30k worth). Our current mortgage is the Desjardins ""Five in One"" Variable Rate. So year one has an additional discount on the interest rate. I've asked them to just put Mortgage A on the same schedule as Mortgage B - so that that portion would also be at the reduced interest rate. But if they don't - an option would be to put cash towards mortgage A, to reduce that total cost. (Our ""mortgage anniversary"" is May 1st, so we'd have an opportunity to hit our pre-payment limit twice.) It would mean increasing the amount we use from the HELOC for the down payment. We're probably talking in the range of $60k to either put towards the mortgage A, or towards the down payment for the new house. Non issue if the bank agrees to put Mortgage A on the same interest schedule as Mortgage B, I think (?).

We also need to decide how much cash to hold back for renos - or do we put as much cash towards the down payment as possible, and use more HELOC for renos?  (I feel like either way, we're ""borrowing"" the cash, but if it's from the HELOC we have a smaller mortgage and can pay the HELOC back on a different/faster schedule than we can the mortgage, where the repayment schedule is constrained.)

150,150,"Ok, I know conventional wisdom of this sub (and the entire country) is to hate the big 3, and I'm totally on board with that. I myself am on a grandfathered plan from Mobilicity. The point of this post though is to a) bring up one potential saving grace of the big 3, and b) hear from you all about this topic.

My parents have been on Rogers for a long time, and I've recently been looking at switching them to Freedom. Let's say they each need 5GB of data (10GB total shared), and one of them needs a new phone. On Rogers (counting all current promotions), they could do $115/month for 6GB shared and a premium+ tab. Premium+ would get an iPhone XR for $0. Then add a second line BYOD for $50/month and an extra 5GB on their current promo.

&#x200B;

In total for Rogers:

$115 Premium+ tab 6GB + $50 BYOD 5GB + ($7 iPhone Visual Voicemail x 2 iPhones) = $179/ 2 people.

&#x200B;

That's insane, right? Well, we're about to see.

Freedom has a promotion right now. $48.25/ person for 10GB each as long as there are at least two lines. Awesome! But what about the new phone? This plan gives access to the $32/month My Tab for 24 months. After paying off the tab, you've now spent $768 on an iPhone XR. With Rogers, the difference between tab and no tab is $25, so with Rogers you're effectively paying ($25 x 24 months =) $600 for the new phone.

&#x200B;

To properly understand this, you really have to look at the price of being with each carrier **for** **two years.**

Rogers: $179 (as per above) x 24 months = $4,296

Freedom: \[$48.25 x 2 people + ($4 iPhone Visual Voicemail x 2 people) \] x 24 months + $768 My Tab = $3,276

...oh

# In Conclusion:

When you buy a phone from the big 3, the price you pay (""the Tab"") has nothing to do with the price of the phone. They just tack on a monthly fee for 24 months, and it usually ends up being less than the full price of the phone. With the smaller brands, the monthly tab you pay will actually end up being the price of the phone after 24 months (unless you catch a promotion). Despite this, the exorbitant prices of the big 3 *still* make them more expensive to go with, even if you're buying a phone. I started writing this post thinking that maybe they had a chance, but I was wrong, and have put too much time into this to delete it.

&#x200B;

# Tl;dr

151,151,"I'm a student with professional LoC debt @ prime minus 0.25% and student loan debt. Here's how I see the problem of whether to pay off student loan vs. LoC, before and after the interest reduction on federal student loans from prime +2.5% to prime (floating rate). Please correct me if I'm wrong. Note: I'm ignoring the Repayment Assistance Program as I wouldn't qualify. I'm also in Ontario.

**Before federal budget 2019 changes:**

	- loan comprised of federal and provincial portions (presumed 70/30 but everyone's split varies)
	- Fed variable interest rate = prime + 2.5 = **6.45%**
	- Prov interest rate = prime + 1 = 4.95%
	- assuming 70/30 fed/prov split, effective rate = 6% (before tax credit adjustment)
	- federal tax credit + prov tax credit = 15 + 5.05 = 20.05% (non-refundable) 
	- final effective rate = 6*(1-.2005) = 4.797%

*So because this is clearly higher than my LoC rate of 3.7%, it would make sense to consolidate my debt into one LoC debt.*

**After federal budget 2019 changes:**

	- Fed variable interest rate = prime = **3.95%**
	- Prov interest rate = prime + 1 = 4.95%
	- assuming 70/30 fed/prov split, effective rate = 4.25% (before tax credit adjustment)
	- federal tax credit + prov tax credit = 15 + 5.05 = 20.05% (non-refundable) 
	- final effective rate = 4.25*(1-.2005) = 3.398%

*After the interest reduction on the federal portion of the loan, it makes sense for me to keep the debts separate, pay off the LoC first (@prime-0.25%), and then pay off student loans.*

I’m looking to consolidate my credit but my current bank (RBC) won’t let me because my debt ratio is too high. I’m currently in the process of selling a house that I own with my ex (490k left on mortgage) that we will sell for about $530k. Bank won’t let me consolidate because both my ex and I are responsible for the entire $490k remaining on the mortgage until the house sells. 

My mortgage is $490k remaining at Scotiabank. 
I have a $30k RBC line of credit at about 7%.
I have $12k in Visa debt with RBC at 20%. I’m trying to switch this to a lower rate but RBC has said no.
I have $4k in Visa debt with Scotiabank at 12%.
I have $9k in MasterCard debt with MBNA at 0% for 5 more months than switching to 8%. 

I make about $90k a year and after taxes and pension I clear about $4500 a month. 

I want to get something figured out with all of the credit card debt ASAP. When the house sells I should end up with $5k in cash. 

I do all of my main banking through RBC but my mortgage is through Scotiabank. Would it make sense to go to Scotiabank and see if they could do something with my debt because they have my mortgage? Are any of the banks like Tangerine/PC Financial etc. worth checking out?

Non-reg acct: 17k I'll be taking a cap loss on this account but it will essentially wash out the gains I made earlier in the year | that's it!

I was thinking that I would liquidate the investment account and TFSA accounts, contribute max RESP funds for the 20% for this year and make up a bit for last year, then pay off my wife's line (about 8k), so that I'm left with approx. $140k in cash, pay down the LOC with my excess income and readjust in six months' time.

the question becomes: what do I do with my 140k in cash? I was looking at buying a house, but with the 89k in student loans, I am screwed on getting any further credit, secured or not. So guys, what would should I do?

PS: if your advice is to pay down the loans with the cash, I have already thought of that and really don't need that perspective, as I can plainly see the benefits. It's good advice, but it's not the perspective I am looking for.

I am trying determine the optimal way to proceed. We can rent out the condo we are currently living in for a monthly rent equivalent to our mortgage payment, taxes, and condo fees so this property will ""pay itself off"" for as long as we own it. 

I know that when buying a second property as a residence or vacation home, you have to put 20% or more down, however our current condo will now become an investment property and the new house will be be our primary residence. Can we buy it with less than 20% down? I know we'll pay for SCHL but we are willing to do it. Is the 20% down an automatic requirement for any second property, even if will be your primary residence?

Should we, perhaps, create a corporation and sell the condo to that ""management company"" and buy the new house personally with 10% or 15% down? What would that entail? I already own two corporations so the corporate maintenance, accounting, and government requirements are a non-issue. 

Condo was purchased in 2015 for $424,000. At maturation in July 2020, the balance will be ~$360,000. Mortgage + taxes + condo fees are $2,450 per month. Downstairs neighbour with a not-as-good condo rents his easily for $2,500 a month and has been for years.

Problem is looking through the Manulife portal, I am seeing that I can only transfer out 95% of the funds while the other 5% are locked-in (the 5% is ~ $2000). From what I understand the 95% is in a regular RRSP while the other 5% is in a LIRA.

I am looking to use CIBCs Investors Edge which stipulates that a minimum of $25k is required to avoid the $100 yearly administrative fee. 

This is no problem for the regular RRSP but if I am understanding correctly the LIRA would get counted as its own account and be dinged $100 yearly. This is steep especially for an account that is worth a total of $2k.

I am hoping my understanding is wrong and my LIRA/RRSP will both get counted against the $25k minimum instead of individually.

I live in Ottawa, Ontario.

I'm looking at renting a house with a friend. We are looking for a third person, and may or may not find someone soon.

The question: if I find a great house for rent right now, I want to act on it fast as they seem to go off the market right away. However, if it's only me and my friend, we'd be the only ones to sign the rental contract. We'd want to add a third person ASAP to the house to get our rent per person lower. If the third person came a month later, how would it work? Could they sign on to the original contract? Would they sublet? Would we need the landlord's approval for any of this, or could we unilaterally do it?

Basically we want to have a 3 person rental but only have 2 people right now, and if a good place is listed we want to grab it ASAP. I'm unclear how this impacts the contract situation. I obviously want to avoid as much liability as possible while retaining the max flexibility. Not sure what strategy to take here or how the law works.

TL;DR = I am heavily in debt and need to get out!

Reasons for this include a divorce, a child with special needs and a serious illness which took nearly a decade to resolve. It severely limited my earnings during this time. 

I finally have a stable, somewhat decent paying job with great prospects for increased compensation/advancement and wish to reduce or eliminate as much debt as possible as fast as possible.

I’ve never missed a payment or not paid a bill. I’ve never had an any accounts in collections. I have never declared bankruptcy. I currently have a credit score of about 700. All my accounts are with RBC or RBC USA. 

Here’s my situation as of today, I rounded up where I could to make the math a little easier. 

Income/Assets/RDSP
- Wages = $4000/month post-tax, paid semi-monthly.

- Canada Child Benefit = $675/month. This goes entirely towards child care and other expenses for my son. He has qualified for the disability tax credit and as of the past tax year I do now list him as a dependent. 

My tax return was $2900 this last year but I am counting on receiving another payment once CRA processes the transfer of the DTC to me. 
 
- RDSP = $16,000 (Deposit only, untouchable.)
- Value of Car = $6500 (Approx)

- CAD Chequing Acct 1 = +$432.77 (Available $500 overdraft)

- CAD Savings Acct 2 = +$2000
- USD Chequing Acct = $5.00 USD

Credit & Loans:
- CAD LOC = $260/month (interest only) Owe $34,000 @ 8.44% Limit $34,000
- CAD VISA = $240/month. Owe $24,375 @ 11.99% Limit $29,500.
- CAD Car Loan = $230/month. Owe $8300 @ 5.49%
- USD VISA = $0/month. Owe $0.00 @ Limit $5000 USD.

- Food = $400/month
- Gasoline = $125/month

1. My $120 MBNA World Elite annual fee was on 3/12. If I was to cancel, do I have to pay it in full, or can I pay a prorated portion of it?

3. One thing I liked about MBNA was that the charges/payments posted very quickly. Charges immediately and payments within 1-2 days. Contrast that with my CIBC visa where payments would post 3-4 days later. It made it much easier for financial planning.

188,188,"I see a lot of questions asking how much someone should have in an emergency fund or the better ways to use emergency funds. Ive seen a lot of viable solutions depending on your risk tolerance, however I have no seen the method I use, which is essentially the most risk free with a couple of added bonuses.
My method: Now this does not work if you are not a homeowner with a mortgage, and if you are ok with a little risk I would say investing and having a HELOC as an emergency is probably the best alternative. If you dont like any risk at all or would even like to incorporate this into your emergency fund with a HELOC though, what I do instead of letting my money sit there and gain very little interest, I use double up payments on my mortgage. This gives me a guaranteed return of close to 3% while also still being usable in a time of emergency. I’m sure most peoples biggest monthly expense is their mortgage and would do the most damage to an emergency fund when its needed. Now with the mortgage I have, every double up payment I do, I am able to skip a payment as well, so if I double up 6 months worth of mortgage payments, I can live without mortgage payments for 6 months in an emergency, instead of just having the cash sitting in a bank account waiting to do the same thing it would in an emergency. This cannot replace your whole fund obviously, but can easily replace the portion allocated to mortgage payments. And if you wanted, you could do a type of hybrid between the emergency fund/emergency HELOC by paying down your mortgage with double ups (no emergency fund) instead of investing in the stock market, with a HELOC that would be growing fairly fast in the event of emergency. 

Tldr: instead of just an emergency fund or HELOC, I use the amount allocated for mortgage payments on double up payments that can be used to skip regular mortgage payments in event of emergency for low risk while still getting a 3% ROI.

The only problem I see is that I am very afraid of our finances, something that my wife, psychologist, and all the helpful redditors will have a hard time finding an appreciation for. Though my wife works, our expenses will certainly be higher than her income, in part because my son is autistic and requires some expensive care and schooling. My detailed calculations are that we can probably go 6 months until I need a job again, maybe a year before the situation gets dire. When I do find another job, it would have to be a mid-manager position that pays at least 70% of what I make now.  Though I've been searching for such a position for a year, it has taken some time to find and even when I do find it there are no guarantees I'll be able to hold it down either - my experience is that all office jobs are stressful with difficult colleagues regardless of what rank you are in the company.

&#x200B;

This also completely excludes that we have 3 aging parents in their late 60s, and 2 adult siblings who are disabled and don't work, none of whom saved sufficiently to support themselves, and we have no plan or finances on how to care for them even if I was working.

There's no way I can summarize all the aspects of my condition, our finances, etc. in a reddit post, so its hard to ask for informed advice .

Here's my details:

Married, 29, living in Toronto. My wife and I make about $110k/yr combined, so not high income, especially for Toronto. We just had a child last month and my wife is taking 18 months of leave, so our income is dropping. When we both were working we would put around $1000 away for savings per month, I haven't calculated how much it is now as we are still going a bit crazy with baby stuff, but I think we will still be putting away at least $200 a month on top of our mortgage while my wife is on leave.

We live in a 2 bedroom condo that we owe $236k on, we bought for $500k end of 2018 with a big downpayment to get the best interest rate we could (prime -1.7 variable), knowing that we wanted to get our monthly costs down as much as possible for the pregnancy leave. I know we probably could have made better returns with this money in the market, but it was a decision we made to reduce my wife's anxiety about being off with limited income. Identical 2 bedroom units on our floor sell for $600-620k now, with the latest sale being last week for $615k for one in slightly worse condition than ours, so I think we did okay on this. The downpayment came from a one bedroom condo we bought for $230k in 2015 and sold for $440k in 2017.

Over the past two years I've made around 400% gains on this portion of my TFSA, but I know that's all luck and not skill, I'm still kicking myself for not dumping $20k into Canopy when it was at $7 a share. I have $20k in my RRSP, 100% in XGRO with DRIP, and another $10k in my company RRSP, which is invested in a U.S. equity mutual fund managed by Manulife (I chose the lowest MER fund I could from what was available, and fortunately it's been doing amazingly, up on average 12% per year I've been contributing).

My wife is a bit more conservative with her money, she has $25k in her TFSA in a 3.95% savings account, and $50k in her RRSP, which I just convinced her to move over with me and put in XGRO with DRIP. The 3.95% is a bonus rate that is expiring September 31, 2019, when it drops down to 3%.

I just opened an RESP for our child and put in $2500, which will be 100% in XGRO with DRIP. I plan to add $2500 each year (to max out the grant from the government), and leave it in XGRO until their 12th birthday and sell for something more conservative, assuming I'm not selling in the middle of a crash, in which case I would hold. I want to make sure that there is enough on hand to pay for their education, even if there is the loss of potential future gains by holding longer.

We also have $10k in a savings account making 3.15% that is our emergency fund. No debt at all between the two of us other than the mortgage. We don't drive, only take public transportation or the occasional Uber or Lyft.

So in sum, anything we could be doing better? I'm currently on the search for a higher paying job - while I love what I do, I work in the charity sector which doesn't pay very much, so I've been casually interviewing for something better paying in the for-profit sector.",1,1,PFC checkup - how am I doing for my age?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/b7tfn6/pfc_checkup_how_am_i_doing_for_my_age/
198,198,"Hello,

Sorry if this is not a correct place to ask this question. I do not have family members or friends to ask for advice (recent immigrant).

I'm living in a basement apartment in Ontario. The unit has foundation leakage issues. I notified it to the landlord, and he said nothing can be done until all the snow melts and gave me just a couple rolls of paper towel. 

The problem gets worse as it gets warmer. I find a decent sized puddle in the middle of the room this morning. 

What is my right as a tenant? What can I ask the landlord?

I asked, and the landlord agrees to terminate the lease earlier, and I'm looking for a new place.

But I don't feel safe to stay in the unit in the meantime. I'm considering moving my stuff to storage and staying in an Air BnB or hotel while looking for a new place. The city I'm in has a pretty tight renting market, and I'm not sure how long it will take. If I do, can I ask for the cost to my landlord? Or is it my responsibility?

Thank you in advance for any advice.",3,1,Water leakage in the unit. Tenant's right? (ON),https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/b7p9wu/water_leakage_in_the_unit_tenants_right_on/
